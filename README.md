This works presents a novel implementation for Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOM) suitable for user behavior analysis in Campus Area Networks (CAN). SOM algorithm works under competitive and unsupervised learning approach, making it perfect for clustering and feature selection tasks. SOM is used to create behavior clusters through the analysis of user network traffic, in fixed time intervals. To demonstrate the feasibility of SOM, resulting users clusters are merged and evaluated against new matching vectors. Experimental results, show that an user can be identified based in it's network traffic since it generates a match in a previous created cluster.
