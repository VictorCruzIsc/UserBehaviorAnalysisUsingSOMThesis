	The research of Anderson et al. [2] and Cabrera et al. [7] deal with statistical methods for intrusion detection.
	Although the two researchers used the same method, the method was used in a different way. The work
	of Anderson et al. [2] is a comprehensive intrusion-detection system that performs real-time monitoring of user
	activity on multiple target systems connected via Ethernet. On the other hand, the statistical method of Cabrera
	et al. [7] is the application of statistical traffic modeling for detecting novel attacks against computer networks.
	Differing from the other researchers, Wenke Lee’s research [26] focuses on theoretical measures for
	anomaly detection. His work uses several information-theoretic measures, namely, entropy, conditional
	entropy, relative conditional entropy, information gain, and information cost for anomaly detection. Also,
	Ryan et al. [36] uses artificial neural networks with supervised learning, based on the back-propagation neural
	network, called Neural Network Intrusion Detector, was trained in the identification task and tests experimentally
	on a system of 10 users.

	Among those unsupervised schemes, MINDS [14] is based on data mining and data clustering methods
	such as Filtering/Preprocessing/Known attack detection module, Scan detector, Anomaly detection algorithms,
	and Summarization of attacks using association pattern analysis. MINDS is still developing a suite
	of data mining techniques to automatically detect attacks against computer networks and systems. Another
	one of unsupervised methods, the research of Eskin et al. [15] and Portnoy et al. [32] are used to detect anomalous
	attacks without pre-existing knowledge. In the case of Eskin’s research, data elements are mapped to a
	feature space, which is a typically vector space, in order to process unlabelled data. Also, Portnoy presented a
	new type of intrusion detection algorithm, which takes a set of unlabeled data as inputs and attempts to find
	3800 T. Shon, J. Moon / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 3799–3821
	intrusion patterns within the data. The basic idea is that since the intrusions are both not normal, and are rare,
	they will appear as outliers in the data. Staniford [39] is the author of SPADE for anomaly-based port scan
	detection in Snort. SPADE utilizes a statistical anomaly detection method with Bayesian probability, and uses
	a simulated annealing method to cluster anomalous packets together into port scans using heuristics developed
	from real scans. Ramaswamy et al. [33] uses an outlier calculation with data mining to propose a novel
	formulation for distance-based outliers, which is based on the distance of a point from its ‘k’ and declares the
	top ‘n’ points to be outliers in this ranking calculation.

	Besides the robustness of the signature, signature-based intrusion detection systems rely on human intervention to create, test, and deploy the signatures.
